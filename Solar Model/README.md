## Team Agnirath
We are a team designing and building a solar powered race car to race in World Solar Challenge.\
The competition is an endurance race in Australia where we begin at Darwin and end at Adelaide (3000km)


## Solar Model
This repo has 2 main goals:
1. Accurately estimate the total solar incident power and energy on our car throughout the race in various conditions.
2. Design the optimal array position and orientation to maximize the total energy recieved.

To do this, We:
1. Interface with the Mech team to balance aerodynamic loss while maximising incident energy
2. Interface with the Strat team to determine energy flows and thus the forcaset position and velocity of the car through the race
